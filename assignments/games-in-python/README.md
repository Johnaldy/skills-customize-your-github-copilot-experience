### 🛠️ Hangman Game Implementation

#### Description
Create a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. The game should provide an enjoyable experience while demonstrating your understanding of string manipulation and game logic.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list of at least 5 words
- Display the current progress using underscores for unguessed letters (e.g., `_ _ _ _ _`)
- Accept single letter guesses from the player and validate input
- Track the number of incorrect guesses remaining (start with 6 attempts)
- Update the display after each guess to show correctly guessed letters
- Prevent duplicate guesses and inform the player if a letter was already guessed
- End the game when the word is fully guessed (win) or attempts are exhausted (lose)
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with the correct word revealed
